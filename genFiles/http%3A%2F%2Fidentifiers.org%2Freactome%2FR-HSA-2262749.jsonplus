To begin the annotation of stress responses in Reactome, we have annotated one aspect of cellular responses to oxygen (Semenza 2004), the role of hypoxia-inducible factor in regulating cellular transcriptional responses to changes in oxygen availability.","Authored: May, B, 2012-05-20","Edited: Matthews, L, 2012-05-20"],"dataSource":["Reactome"],"title":["Cellular response to hypoxia"]}}
