{"nodes":[],"edges":[],"pathwayMetadata":{"comments":["Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are found in the postsynaptic terminals and these receptors are responsible in mediating postsynaptic currents. Most common types of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are homomeric alpha 7 containing acetylcholine receptors. The densities of acetylcholine receptors are found to be similar to NMDA and AMPA receptors at these sites. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors may permit both sodium and calcium ions, however, the ratio of sodium and calcium influx makes the receptors either highly sodium permeable or highly calcium permeable.","Edited: Gillespie, ME, 2010-05-18","Authored: Mahajan, SS, 2010-04-26","Reviewed: Cooper, E, 2010-05-24"],"dataSource":["Reactome"],"title":["Postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors"]}}
