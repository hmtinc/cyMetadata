{"nodes":[],"edges":[],"pathwayMetadata":{"comments":["Metabolic processes in human cells generate energy through the oxidation of molecules consumed in the diet and mediate the synthesis of diverse essential molecules not taken in the diet as well as the inactivation and elimination of toxic ones generated endogenously or present in the extracellular environment. Mutations that disrupt these processes by inactivating a required enzyme or regulatory protein, or more rarely by changing its specificity can lead to severe diseases. Ones annotated here involve aspects of carbohydrate, amino acid, and vitamin metabolism, and biological oxidations. One somatic mutation that affects cytosolic isocitrate metabolism, often found in glioblastomas and some lymphoid neoplasms, is also annotated."],"dataSource":["Reactome"],"title":["Diseases of metabolism"]}}
