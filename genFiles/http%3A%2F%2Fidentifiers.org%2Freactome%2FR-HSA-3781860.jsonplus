These glycoconjugates play critical roles in processes such as metabolism, cell recognition and adhesion, cell migration, protease resistance, host defense, and antigenicity. CDGs are divided into 2 main groups: type I CDGs comprise defects in the assembly of the dolichol lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) chain and its transfer to the nascent protein, whereas type II CDGs comprise defects in the trimming and processing of protein-bound glycans (Marquardt & Denecke 2003, Grunewald et al. 2002, Hennet 2012, Cylwik et al. 2013)."],"dataSource":["Reactome"],"title":["Diseases associated with N-glycosylation of proteins"]}}
