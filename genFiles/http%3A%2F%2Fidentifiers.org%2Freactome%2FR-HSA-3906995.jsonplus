Glycosylation can be further categorized into N-linked (where the oligosaccharide is conjugated to Asparagine residues) and O-linked glycosylation (where the oligosaccharide is conjugated to Serine, Threonine and possibly Tyrosine residues). Within the family of O-linked glycosylation, the oligosaccharides attached can be further categorized according to their reducing end residue: GalNAc (often described as mucin-type, due to the abundance of this type of glycosylation on mucins), Mannose and Fucose. This section reviews currently known congenital disorders of glycosylation associated with defects of protein O-glycosylation (Cylwik et al. 2013, Freeze et al. 2014)."],"dataSource":["Reactome"],"title":["Diseases associated with O-glycosylation of proteins"]}}
