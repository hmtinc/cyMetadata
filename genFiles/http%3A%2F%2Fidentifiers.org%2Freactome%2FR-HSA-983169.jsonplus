They bind peptide fragments of these proteins and presenting them to CD8+ T cells at the cell surface. This enables cytotoxic T cells to identify and eliminate cells that are synthesizing abnormal or foreign proteins. MHC class I is a trimeric complex composed of a polymorphic heavy chain (HC or alpha chain) and an invariable light chain, known as beta2-microglobulin (B2M) plus an 8-10 residue peptide ligand. Represented here are the events in the biosynthesis of MHC class I molecules, including generation of antigenic peptides by the ubiquitin/26S-proteasome system, delivery of these peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), loading of peptides to MHC class I molecules and display of MHC class I complexes on the cell surface.","Edited: Garapati, P V, 2010-10-29","Reviewed: Elliott, T, 2011-02-10"],"dataSource":["Reactome"],"title":["Class I MHC mediated antigen processing & presentation"]}}
