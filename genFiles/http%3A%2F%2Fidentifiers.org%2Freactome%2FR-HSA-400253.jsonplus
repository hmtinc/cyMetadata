The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock islight, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN.The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronaland hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues,aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadianrhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with itsenvironment at the molecular level by regulating gene expressionto create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours tocontrol when a particular physiological process is most activewith respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. The NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimerpositively regulates the expression of MAOA, F7 and LDHA andmodulates the circadian rhythm of daytime contrast sensitivity byregulating the rhythmic expression of adenylate cyclase type 1(ADCY1) in the retina. NPAS2 plays an important role in sleephomeostasis and in maintaining circadian behaviors in normallight/dark and feeding conditions and in the effectivesynchronization of feeding behavior with scheduled foodavailability. Regulates the gene transcription of key metabolicpathways in the liver and is involved in DNA damage response byregulating several cell cycle and DNA repair genes.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:11441146, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11441147,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18439826,ECO:0000269|PubMed:18819933}.COFACTOR:Name=heme; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:30413;Evidence={ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97460};ENZYME REGULATION: Carbon monoxide (CO) and the redox state of thecell can modulate the transcriptional activity of the NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer.

A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. The NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimerpositively regulates the expression of MAOA, F7 and LDHA andmodulates the circadian rhythm of daytime contrast sensitivity byregulating the rhythmic expression of adenylate cyclase type 1(ADCY1) in the retina. NPAS2 plays an important role in sleephomeostasis and in maintaining circadian behaviors in normallight/dark and feeding conditions and in the effectivesynchronization of feeding behavior with scheduled foodavailability. Regulates the gene transcription of key metabolicpathways in the liver and is involved in DNA damage response byregulating several cell cycle and DNA repair genes.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:11441146, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11441147,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18439826,ECO:0000269|PubMed:18819933}.COFACTOR:Name=heme; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:30413;Evidence={ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97460};ENZYME REGULATION: Carbon monoxide (CO) and the redox state of thecell can modulate the transcriptional activity of the NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer.

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock islight, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN.The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronaland hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues,aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadianrhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with itsenvironment at the molecular level by regulating gene expressionto create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours tocontrol when a particular physiological process is most activewith respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. ARNTL/BMAL1 positively regulatesmyogenesis and negatively regulates adipogenesis via thetranscriptional control of the genes of the canonical Wntsignaling pathway. Plays a role in normal pancreatic beta-cellfunction; regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via theregulation of antioxidant genes NFE2L2/NRF2 and its targets SESN2,PRDX3, CCLC and CCLM. Negatively regulates the mTORC1 signalingpathway; regulates the expression of MTOR and DEPTOR. Controlsdiurnal oscillations of Ly6C inflammatory monocytes; rhythmicrecruitment of the PRC2 complex imparts diurnal variation tochemokine expression that is necessary to sustain Ly6C monocyterhythms. Regulates the expression of HSD3B2, STAR, PTGS2, CYP11A1,CYP19A1 and LHCGR in the ovary and also the genes involved in hairgrowth. Plays an important role in adult hippocampal neurogenesisby regulating the timely entry of neural stem/progenitor cells(NSPCs) into the cell cycle and the number of cell divisions thattake place prior to cell-cycle exit. Regulates the circadianexpression of CIART and KLF11. The CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimerregulates the circadian expression of SERPINE1/PAI1, VWF, B3,CCRN4L/NOC, NAMPT, DBP, MYOD1, PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, SIRT1, GYS2,F7, NGFR, GNRHR, BHLHE40/DEC1, ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 and also genesimplicated in glucose and lipid metabolism. Repressesglucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activityby reducing the association of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid responseelements (GREs) via the acetylation of multiple lysine residueslocated in its hinge region. Promotes rhythmic chromatin opening,regulating the DNA accessibility of other transcription factors.The NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer positively regulates theexpression of MAOA, F7 and LDHA and modulates the circadian rhythmof daytime contrast sensitivity by regulating the rhythmicexpression of adenylate cyclase type 1 (ADCY1) in the retina. Thepreferred binding motif for the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer is5'-CACGTGA-3', which contains a flanking Ala residue in additionto the canonical 6-nucleotide E-box sequence (PubMed:23229515).CLOCK specifically binds to the half-site 5'-CAC-3', while ARNTLbinds to the half-site 5'-GTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515).

A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. CRY1 and CRY2 have redundantfunctions but also differential and selective contributions atleast in defining the pace of the SCN circadian clock and itscircadian transcriptional outputs. More potent transcriptionalrepressor in cerebellum and liver than CRY2, though more effectivein lengthening the period of the SCN oscillator. On its side, CRY2seems to play a critical role in tuning SCN circadian period byopposing the action of CRY1. With CRY2, is dispensable forcircadian rhythm generation but necessary for the development ofintercellular networks for rhythm synchrony. Capable oftranslocating circadian clock core proteins such as PER proteinsto the nucleus. Interacts with CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 independently ofPER proteins and is found at CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1-bound sites,suggesting that CRY may act as a molecular gatekeeper to maintainCLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 in a poised and repressed state until the propertime for transcriptional activation. Represses the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 induced transcription of BHLHE40/DEC1. Represses theCLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 induced transcription of ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 andNAMPT (By similarity). May repress circadian target genesexpression in collaboration with HDAC1 and HDAC2 through histonedeacetylation. Mediates the clock-control activation of ATR andmodulates ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint. In liver, mediatescircadian regulation of cAMP signaling and gluconeogenesis bybinding to membrane-coupled G proteins and blocking glucagon-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations and CREB1phosphorylation. Besides its role in the maintenance of thecircadian clock, is also involved in the regulation of otherprocesses. Represses glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-inducedtranscriptional activity by binding to glucocorticoid responseelements (GREs). Plays a key role in glucose and lipid metabolismmodulation, in part, through the transcriptional regulation ofgenes involved in these pathways, such as LEP or ACSL4.{ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10531061,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14672706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22170608,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23133559, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28388406}.COFACTOR:Name=FAD; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:57692;Note=Binds 1 FAD per subunit.

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock islight, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN.The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronaland hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues,aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle.

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock islight, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN.The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronaland hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues,aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadianrhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with itsenvironment at the molecular level by regulating gene expressionto create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours tocontrol when a particular physiological process is most activewith respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. Regulates circadian target genesexpression at post-transcriptional levels, but may not be requiredfor the repression at transcriptional level. Controls PER2 proteindecay. Represses CRY2 preventing its repression on CLOCK/ARNTLtarget genes such as FXYD5 and SCNN1A in kidney and PPARA inliver. Besides its involvement in the maintenance of the circadianclock, has an important function in the regulation of severalprocesses. Participates in the repression of glucocorticoidreceptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by reducing theassociation of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs)by ARNTL:CLOCK. Plays a role in the modulation of theneuroinflammatory state via the regulation of inflammatorymediators release, such as CCL2 and IL6. In spinal astrocytes,negatively regulates the MAPK14/p38 and MAPK8/JNK MAPK cascades aswell as the subsequent activation of NFkappaB. Coordinatelyregulates the expression of multiple genes that are involved inthe regulation of renal sodium reabsorption. Can act as geneexpression activator in a gene and tissue specific manner, inkidney enhances WNK1 and SLC12A3 expression in collaboration withCLOCK. Modulates hair follicle cycling. Represses the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 induced transcription of BHLHE40/DEC1.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:24005054}.SUBUNIT: Homodimer.

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock islight, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN.The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronaland hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues,aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadianrhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with itsenvironment at the molecular level by regulating gene expressionto create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours tocontrol when a particular physiological process is most activewith respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively.

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock islight, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN.The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronaland hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues,aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadianrhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with itsenvironment at the molecular level by regulating gene expressionto create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours tocontrol when a particular physiological process is most activewith respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. The NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimerpositively regulates the expression of MAOA, F7 and LDHA andmodulates the circadian rhythm of daytime contrast sensitivity byregulating the rhythmic expression of adenylate cyclase type 1(ADCY1) in the retina. NPAS2 plays an important role in sleephomeostasis and in maintaining circadian behaviors in normallight/dark and feeding conditions and in the effectivesynchronization of feeding behavior with scheduled foodavailability. Regulates the gene transcription of key metabolicpathways in the liver and is involved in DNA damage response byregulating several cell cycle and DNA repair genes.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:11441146, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11441147,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18439826,ECO:0000269|PubMed:18819933}.COFACTOR:Name=heme; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:30413;Evidence={ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97460};ENZYME REGULATION: Carbon monoxide (CO) and the redox state of thecell can modulate the transcriptional activity of the NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer.

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock islight, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN.The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronaland hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues,aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadianrhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with itsenvironment at the molecular level by regulating gene expressionto create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours tocontrol when a particular physiological process is most activewith respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. The NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimerpositively regulates the expression of MAOA, F7 and LDHA andmodulates the circadian rhythm of daytime contrast sensitivity byregulating the rhythmic expression of adenylate cyclase type 1(ADCY1) in the retina. NPAS2 plays an important role in sleephomeostasis and in maintaining circadian behaviors in normallight/dark and feeding conditions and in the effectivesynchronization of feeding behavior with scheduled foodavailability. Regulates the gene transcription of key metabolicpathways in the liver and is involved in DNA damage response byregulating several cell cycle and DNA repair genes.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:11441146, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11441147,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18439826,ECO:0000269|PubMed:18819933}.COFACTOR:Name=heme; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:30413;Evidence={ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97460};ENZYME REGULATION: Carbon monoxide (CO) and the redox state of thecell can modulate the transcriptional activity of the NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer.

Recognizes and binds to phosphorylated targetproteins. SCF(BTRC) mediates the ubiquitination of CTNNB1 andparticipates in Wnt signaling. SCF(BTRC) mediates theubiquitination of NFKBIA, NFKBIB and NFKBIE; the degradation freesthe associated NFKB1 to translocate into the nucleus and toactivate transcription. Ubiquitination of NFKBIA occurs at 'Lys-21' and 'Lys-22'. SCF(BTRC) mediates the ubiquitination of CEP68;this is required for centriole separation during mitosis(PubMed:25704143, PubMed:25503564). SCF(BTRC) mediates theubiquitination of phosphorylated NFKB1/nuclear factor NF-kappa-Bp105 subunit, ATF4, CDC25A, DLG1, FBXO5, PER1, SMAD3, SMAD4, SNAI1and probably NFKB2. Has an essential role in the control of theclock-dependent transcription via degradation of phosphorylatedPER1 and PER2. May be involved in ubiquitination and subsequentproteasomal degradation through a DBB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin-proteinligase. Required for activation of NFKB-mediated transcription byIL1B, MAP3K14, MAP3K1, IKBKB and TNF.

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock islight, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN.The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronaland hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues,aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadianrhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with itsenvironment at the molecular level by regulating gene expressionto create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours tocontrol when a particular physiological process is most activewith respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. The NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimerpositively regulates the expression of MAOA, F7 and LDHA andmodulates the circadian rhythm of daytime contrast sensitivity byregulating the rhythmic expression of adenylate cyclase type 1(ADCY1) in the retina. NPAS2 plays an important role in sleephomeostasis and in maintaining circadian behaviors in normallight/dark and feeding conditions and in the effectivesynchronization of feeding behavior with scheduled foodavailability. Regulates the gene transcription of key metabolicpathways in the liver and is involved in DNA damage response byregulating several cell cycle and DNA repair genes.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:11441146, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11441147,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18439826,ECO:0000269|PubMed:18819933}.COFACTOR:Name=heme; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:30413;Evidence={ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97460};ENZYME REGULATION: Carbon monoxide (CO) and the redox state of thecell can modulate the transcriptional activity of the NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer.

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock islight, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN.The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronaland hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues,aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadianrhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with itsenvironment at the molecular level by regulating gene expressionto create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours tocontrol when a particular physiological process is most activewith respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. The NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimerpositively regulates the expression of MAOA, F7 and LDHA andmodulates the circadian rhythm of daytime contrast sensitivity byregulating the rhythmic expression of adenylate cyclase type 1(ADCY1) in the retina. NPAS2 plays an important role in sleephomeostasis and in maintaining circadian behaviors in normallight/dark and feeding conditions and in the effectivesynchronization of feeding behavior with scheduled foodavailability.

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock islight, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN.The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronaland hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues,aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadianrhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with itsenvironment at the molecular level by regulating gene expressionto create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours tocontrol when a particular physiological process is most activewith respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. ARNTL/BMAL1 positively regulatesmyogenesis and negatively regulates adipogenesis via thetranscriptional control of the genes of the canonical Wntsignaling pathway. Plays a role in normal pancreatic beta-cellfunction; regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via theregulation of antioxidant genes NFE2L2/NRF2 and its targets SESN2,PRDX3, CCLC and CCLM. Negatively regulates the mTORC1 signalingpathway; regulates the expression of MTOR and DEPTOR. Controlsdiurnal oscillations of Ly6C inflammatory monocytes; rhythmicrecruitment of the PRC2 complex imparts diurnal variation tochemokine expression that is necessary to sustain Ly6C monocyterhythms. Regulates the expression of HSD3B2, STAR, PTGS2, CYP11A1,CYP19A1 and LHCGR in the ovary and also the genes involved in hairgrowth. Plays an important role in adult hippocampal neurogenesisby regulating the timely entry of neural stem/progenitor cells(NSPCs) into the cell cycle and the number of cell divisions thattake place prior to cell-cycle exit. Regulates the circadianexpression of CIART and KLF11. The CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimerregulates the circadian expression of SERPINE1/PAI1, VWF, B3,CCRN4L/NOC, NAMPT, DBP, MYOD1, PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, SIRT1, GYS2,F7, NGFR, GNRHR, BHLHE40/DEC1, ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 and also genesimplicated in glucose and lipid metabolism. Repressesglucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activityby reducing the association of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid responseelements (GREs) via the acetylation of multiple lysine residueslocated in its hinge region. Promotes rhythmic chromatin opening,regulating the DNA accessibility of other transcription factors.The NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer positively regulates theexpression of MAOA, F7 and LDHA and modulates the circadian rhythmof daytime contrast sensitivity by regulating the rhythmicexpression of adenylate cyclase type 1 (ADCY1) in the retina. Thepreferred binding motif for the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer is5'-CACGTGA-3', which contains a flanking Ala residue in additionto the canonical 6-nucleotide E-box sequence (PubMed:23229515).CLOCK specifically binds to the half-site 5'-CAC-3', while ARNTLbinds to the half-site 5'-GTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515). The CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer also recognizes the non-canonical E-boxmotifs 5'-AACGTGA-3' and 5'-CATGTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515).{ECO:0000269|PubMed:11441146, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12738229,ECO:0000269|PubMed:18587630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23785138,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23955654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24005054}.ENZYME REGULATION: There is conflicting data about the effect ofNAD cofactors on activity.

Ubiquitin is usuallyconjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rarecases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed. Whenpolyubiquitin is free (unanchored-polyubiquitin), it also hasdistinct roles, such as in activation of protein kinases, and insignaling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16543144,ECO:0000269|PubMed:19754430}.SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Ubiquitin: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}.

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock islight, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN.The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronaland hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues,aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadianrhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with itsenvironment at the molecular level by regulating gene expressionto create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours tocontrol when a particular physiological process is most activewith respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. Regulates circadian target genesexpression at post-transcriptional levels, but may not be requiredfor the repression at transcriptional level. Controls PER2 proteindecay. Represses CRY2 preventing its repression on CLOCK/ARNTLtarget genes such as FXYD5 and SCNN1A in kidney and PPARA inliver. Besides its involvement in the maintenance of the circadianclock, has an important function in the regulation of severalprocesses. Participates in the repression of glucocorticoidreceptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by reducing theassociation of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs)by ARNTL:CLOCK. Plays a role in the modulation of theneuroinflammatory state via the regulation of inflammatorymediators release, such as CCL2 and IL6. In spinal astrocytes,negatively regulates the MAPK14/p38 and MAPK8/JNK MAPK cascades aswell as the subsequent activation of NFkappaB. Coordinatelyregulates the expression of multiple genes that are involved inthe regulation of renal sodium reabsorption. Can act as geneexpression activator in a gene and tissue specific manner, inkidney enhances WNK1 and SLC12A3 expression in collaboration withCLOCK. Modulates hair follicle cycling.

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock islight, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN.The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronaland hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues,aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadianrhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with itsenvironment at the molecular level by regulating gene expressionto create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours tocontrol when a particular physiological process is most activewith respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters.

This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. Regulates circadian target genesexpression at post-transcriptional levels, but may not be requiredfor the repression at transcriptional level. Controls PER2 proteindecay.

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock islight, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN.The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronaland hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues,aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadianrhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with itsenvironment at the molecular level by regulating gene expressionto create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours tocontrol when a particular physiological process is most activewith respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. CRY1 and CRY2 have redundantfunctions but also differential and selective contributions atleast in defining the pace of the SCN circadian clock and itscircadian transcriptional outputs. More potent transcriptionalrepressor in cerebellum and liver than CRY2, though more effectivein lengthening the period of the SCN oscillator. On its side, CRY2seems to play a critical role in tuning SCN circadian period byopposing the action of CRY1. With CRY2, is dispensable forcircadian rhythm generation but necessary for the development ofintercellular networks for rhythm synchrony. Capable oftranslocating circadian clock core proteins such as PER proteinsto the nucleus. Interacts with CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 independently ofPER proteins and is found at CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1-bound sites,suggesting that CRY may act as a molecular gatekeeper to maintainCLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 in a poised and repressed state until the propertime for transcriptional activation. Represses the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 induced transcription of BHLHE40/DEC1. Represses theCLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 induced transcription of ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 andNAMPT (By similarity). May repress circadian target genesexpression in collaboration with HDAC1 and HDAC2 through histonedeacetylation. Mediates the clock-control activation of ATR andmodulates ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint. In liver, mediatescircadian regulation of cAMP signaling and gluconeogenesis bybinding to membrane-coupled G proteins and blocking glucagon-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations and CREB1phosphorylation. Besides its role in the maintenance of thecircadian clock, is also involved in the regulation of otherprocesses. Represses glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-inducedtranscriptional activity by binding to glucocorticoid responseelements (GREs). Plays a key role in glucose and lipid metabolismmodulation, in part, through the transcriptional regulation ofgenes involved in these pathways, such as LEP or ACSL4.{ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10531061,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14672706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22170608,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23133559, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28388406}.COFACTOR:Name=FAD; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:57692;Note=Binds 1 FAD per subunit.

Peak expression in the suprachiasmanucleus (SCN) and eye at the day/night transition (CT12). Levelsdecrease with ARNTL/BMAL1-CLOCK inhibition as part of theautoregulatory feedback loop.PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-247 by MAPK is important for theinhibition of CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activity.Phosphorylation by CSNK1E requires interaction with PER1 or PER2.Phosphorylation at Ser-71 and Ser-280 by AMPK decreases proteinstability. Phosphorylation at Ser-568 exhibits a robust circadianrhythm with a peak at CT8, increases protein stability, preventsSCF(FBXL3)-mediated degradation and is antagonized by interactionwith PRKDC. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784}.PTM: Ubiquitinated by the SCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes,regulating the balance between degradation and stabilization. TheSCF(FBXL3) complex is mainly nuclear and mediates ubiquitinationand subsequent degradation of CRY1. In contrast, cytoplasmicSCF(FBXL21) complex-mediated ubiquitination leads to stabilizeCRY1 and counteract the activity of the SCF(FBXL3) complex. TheSCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes probably mediateubiquitination at different Lys residues. Ubiquitination at Lys-11and Lys-107 are specifically ubiquitinated by the SCF(FBXL21)complex but not by the SCF(FBXL3) complex. Ubiquitination may beinhibited by PER2. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17463251,ECO:0000269|PubMed:22798407, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27565346}.DISEASE: Note=Defects in CRY1 may be a cause of susceptibility todelayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), a common form of insomnia inwhich sleep episodes are shifted to later times misaligned withthe societal norm. An adenine-to-cytosine transversion within the5'splice site following exon 11 has been found in multiple membersof a DSPD family and segregates with the disorder with autosomaldominant inheritance pattern. This variant is predicted to causeexon 11 skipping and in-frame deletion of 24 residues in the C-terminal region of CRY1. Functional studies show that the mutatedprotein acts as a more potent transcriptional repressor than wild-type, causes reduced expression of key transcriptional targets andlengthens the period of circadian molecular rhythms.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:28388406}.SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA photolyase class-1 family.{ECO:0000305}.WEB RESOURCE: Name=Wikipedia; Note=Cryptochrome entry;URL=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptochrome\"; COPYRIGHT: UniProt Consortium (www.uniprot.org).

Besides its role in the maintenance of thecircadian clock, is also involved in the regulation of otherprocesses. Represses glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-inducedtranscriptional activity by binding to glucocorticoid responseelements (GREs). Plays a key role in glucose and lipid metabolismmodulation, in part, through the transcriptional regulation ofgenes involved in these pathways, such as LEP or ACSL4.{ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10531061,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14672706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22170608,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23133559, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28388406}.COFACTOR:Name=FAD; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:57692;Note=Binds 1 FAD per subunit.

Interacts directly with TIMELESS. Interacts directlywith PER1 and PER2 C-terminal domains. Interaction with PER2inhibits its ubiquitination and vice versa. Interacts with FBXL21.Interacts with FBXL3. Interacts with PPP5C (via TPR repeats).Interacts with CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 independently of PER2 and DNA.Interacts with HDAC1, HDAC2 and SIN3B. Interacts with nuclearreceptors AR, NR1D1, NR3C1/GR, RORA and RORC; the interaction withat least NR3C1/GR is ligand dependent. Interacts with PRKDC.Interacts with the G protein subunit alpha GNAS; the interactionmay block GPCR-mediated regulation of cAMP concentrations.Interacts with PRMT5. Interacts with EZH2 (By similarity).Interacts with MYBBP1A, DOCK7, HNRNPU, RPL7A, RPL8 and RPS3 (Bysimilarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784,ECO:0000269|PubMed:16790549, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17463251,ECO:0000269|PubMed:20852621, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21613214,ECO:0000269|PubMed:22170608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23133559,ECO:0000269|PubMed:28388406}.SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.

Peak expression in the suprachiasmanucleus (SCN) and eye at the day/night transition (CT12). Levelsdecrease with ARNTL/BMAL1-CLOCK inhibition as part of theautoregulatory feedback loop.PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-247 by MAPK is important for theinhibition of CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activity.Phosphorylation by CSNK1E requires interaction with PER1 or PER2.Phosphorylation at Ser-71 and Ser-280 by AMPK decreases proteinstability. Phosphorylation at Ser-568 exhibits a robust circadianrhythm with a peak at CT8, increases protein stability, preventsSCF(FBXL3)-mediated degradation and is antagonized by interactionwith PRKDC. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784}.PTM: Ubiquitinated by the SCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes,regulating the balance between degradation and stabilization. TheSCF(FBXL3) complex is mainly nuclear and mediates ubiquitinationand subsequent degradation of CRY1. In contrast, cytoplasmicSCF(FBXL21) complex-mediated ubiquitination leads to stabilizeCRY1 and counteract the activity of the SCF(FBXL3) complex. TheSCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes probably mediateubiquitination at different Lys residues. Ubiquitination at Lys-11and Lys-107 are specifically ubiquitinated by the SCF(FBXL21)complex but not by the SCF(FBXL3) complex. Ubiquitination may beinhibited by PER2. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17463251,ECO:0000269|PubMed:22798407, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27565346}.DISEASE: Note=Defects in CRY1 may be a cause of susceptibility todelayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), a common form of insomnia inwhich sleep episodes are shifted to later times misaligned withthe societal norm. An adenine-to-cytosine transversion within the5'splice site following exon 11 has been found in multiple membersof a DSPD family and segregates with the disorder with autosomaldominant inheritance pattern. This variant is predicted to causeexon 11 skipping and in-frame deletion of 24 residues in the C-terminal region of CRY1. Functional studies show that the mutatedprotein acts as a more potent transcriptional repressor than wild-type, causes reduced expression of key transcriptional targets andlengthens the period of circadian molecular rhythms.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:28388406}.SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA photolyase class-1 family.{ECO:0000305}.WEB RESOURCE: Name=Wikipedia; Note=Cryptochrome entry;URL=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptochrome\"; COPYRIGHT: UniProt Consortium (www.uniprot.org).

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock islight, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN.The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronaland hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues,aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadianrhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with itsenvironment at the molecular level by regulating gene expressionto create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours tocontrol when a particular physiological process is most activewith respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. Regulates circadian target genesexpression at post-transcriptional levels, but may not be requiredfor the repression at transcriptional level. Controls PER2 proteindecay. Represses CRY2 preventing its repression on CLOCK/ARNTLtarget genes such as FXYD5 and SCNN1A in kidney and PPARA inliver. Besides its involvement in the maintenance of the circadianclock, has an important function in the regulation of severalprocesses. Participates in the repression of glucocorticoidreceptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by reducing theassociation of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs)by ARNTL:CLOCK. Plays a role in the modulation of theneuroinflammatory state via the regulation of inflammatorymediators release, such as CCL2 and IL6. In spinal astrocytes,negatively regulates the MAPK14/p38 and MAPK8/JNK MAPK cascades aswell as the subsequent activation of NFkappaB. Coordinatelyregulates the expression of multiple genes that are involved inthe regulation of renal sodium reabsorption. Can act as geneexpression activator in a gene and tissue specific manner, inkidney enhances WNK1 and SLC12A3 expression in collaboration withCLOCK. Modulates hair follicle cycling.

Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. Regulates circadian target genesexpression at post-transcriptional levels, but may not be requiredfor the repression at transcriptional level. Controls PER2 proteindecay. Represses CRY2 preventing its repression on CLOCK/ARNTLtarget genes such as FXYD5 and SCNN1A in kidney and PPARA inliver. Besides its involvement in the maintenance of the circadianclock, has an important function in the regulation of severalprocesses. Participates in the repression of glucocorticoidreceptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by reducing theassociation of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs)by ARNTL:CLOCK. Plays a role in the modulation of theneuroinflammatory state via the regulation of inflammatorymediators release, such as CCL2 and IL6. In spinal astrocytes,negatively regulates the MAPK14/p38 and MAPK8/JNK MAPK cascades aswell as the subsequent activation of NFkappaB. Coordinatelyregulates the expression of multiple genes that are involved inthe regulation of renal sodium reabsorption. Can act as geneexpression activator in a gene and tissue specific manner, inkidney enhances WNK1 and SLC12A3 expression in collaboration withCLOCK. Modulates hair follicle cycling. Represses the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 induced transcription of BHLHE40/DEC1.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:24005054}.SUBUNIT: Homodimer.

This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. CLOCK has an intrinsicacetyltransferase activity, which enables circadian chromatinremodeling by acetylating histones and nonhistone proteins,including its own partner ARNTL/BMAL1. Regulates the circadianexpression of ICAM1, VCAM1, CCL2, THPO and MPL and also acts as anenhancer of the transactivation potential of NF-kappaB. Plays animportant role in the homeostatic regulation of sleep. The CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer regulates the circadian expression ofSERPINE1/PAI1, VWF, B3, CCRN4L/NOC, NAMPT, DBP, MYOD1, PPARGC1A,PPARGC1B, SIRT1, GYS2, F7, NGFR, GNRHR, BHLHE40/DEC1, ATF4, MTA1,KLF10 and also genes implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism.Represses glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptionalactivity by reducing the association of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoidresponse elements (GREs) via the acetylation of multiple lysineresidues located in its hinge region.

Transcription and translation ofcore clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2,PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythmgeneration, whereas delays imposed by post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period(tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and isthe length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm issynchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian andinfradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute tothe pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolicsyndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop(TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 orARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act inthe form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of coreclock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolicprocesses), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within theirpromoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which aretranscriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedbackloop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negativelyregulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activatesnuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a secondfeedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1transcription, respectively. CRY1 and CRY2 have redundantfunctions but also differential and selective contributions atleast in defining the pace of the SCN circadian clock and itscircadian transcriptional outputs. More potent transcriptionalrepressor in cerebellum and liver than CRY2, though more effectivein lengthening the period of the SCN oscillator. On its side, CRY2seems to play a critical role in tuning SCN circadian period byopposing the action of CRY1. With CRY2, is dispensable forcircadian rhythm generation but necessary for the development ofintercellular networks for rhythm synchrony. Capable oftranslocating circadian clock core proteins such as PER proteinsto the nucleus. Interacts with CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 independently ofPER proteins and is found at CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1-bound sites,suggesting that CRY may act as a molecular gatekeeper to maintainCLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 in a poised and repressed state until the propertime for transcriptional activation. Represses the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 induced transcription of BHLHE40/DEC1. Represses theCLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 induced transcription of ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 andNAMPT (By similarity). May repress circadian target genesexpression in collaboration with HDAC1 and HDAC2 through histonedeacetylation. Mediates the clock-control activation of ATR andmodulates ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint. In liver, mediatescircadian regulation of cAMP signaling and gluconeogenesis bybinding to membrane-coupled G proteins and blocking glucagon-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations and CREB1phosphorylation. Besides its role in the maintenance of thecircadian clock, is also involved in the regulation of otherprocesses. Represses glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-inducedtranscriptional activity by binding to glucocorticoid responseelements (GREs). Plays a key role in glucose and lipid metabolismmodulation, in part, through the transcriptional regulation ofgenes involved in these pathways, such as LEP or ACSL4.{ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10531061,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14672706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22170608,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23133559, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28388406}.COFACTOR:Name=FAD; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:57692;Note=Binds 1 FAD per subunit.

The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes throughthe generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in geneexpression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism andbehavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array ofphysiological functions including metabolism, sleep, bodytemperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular,and renal function. Consists of two major components: the centralclock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain,and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissueand organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can bereset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for'timegivers').

Histone deacetylation givesa tag for epigenetic repression and plays an important role intranscriptional regulation, cell cycle progression anddevelopmental events. Histone deacetylases act via the formationof large multiprotein complexes. Participates in the BCL6transcriptional repressor activity by deacetylating the H3 'Lys-27' (H3K27) on enhancer elements, antagonizing EP300acetyltransferase activity and repressing proximal geneexpression. Probably participates in the regulation oftranscription through its binding to the zinc-finger transcriptionfactor YY1; increases YY1 repression activity. Required to represstranscription of the POU1F1 transcription factor. Acts as amolecular chaperone for shuttling phosphorylated NR2C1 to PMLbodies for sumoylation (PubMed:21444723, PubMed:23911289).Contributes, together with XBP1 isoform 1, to the activation ofNFE2L2-mediated HMOX1 transcription factor gene expression in aPI(3)K/mTORC2/Akt-dependent signaling pathway leading toendothelial cell (EC) survival under disturbed flow/oxidativestress (PubMed:25190803). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21444723,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23911289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25190803}.CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of an N(6)-acetyl-lysine residue ofa histone to yield a deacetylated histone.SUBUNIT: Interacts with HDAC7 and HDAC9.

Integralcomponent of the complex transcription machinery that governscircadian rhythmicity and forms a critical negative limb of thecircadian clock by directly repressing the expression of coreclock components ARTNL/BMAL1, CLOCK and CRY1. Also regulates genesinvolved in metabolic functions, including lipid and bile acidmetabolism, adipogenesis, gluconeogenesis and the macrophageinflammatory response. Acts as a receptor for heme whichstimulates its interaction with the NCOR1/HDAC3 corepressorcomplex, enhancing transcriptional repression. Recognizes twoclasses of DNA response elements within the promoter of its targetgenes and can bind to DNA as either monomers or homodimers,depending on the nature of the response element. Binds as amonomer to a response element composed of the consensus half-sitemotif 5'-[A/G]GGTCA-3' preceded by an A/T-rich 5' sequence(RevRE), or as a homodimer to a direct repeat of the core motifspaced by two nucleotides (RevDR-2). Acts as a potent competitiverepressor of ROR alpha (RORA) function and regulates the levels ofits ligand heme by repressing the expression of PPARGC1A, a potentinducer of heme synthesis. Regulates lipid metabolism byrepressing the expression of APOC3 and by influencing the activityof sterol response element binding proteins (SREBPs); repressesINSIG2 which interferes with the proteolytic activation of SREBPswhich in turn govern the rhythmic expression of enzymes with keyfunctions in sterol and fatty acid synthesis. Regulatesgluconeogenesis via repression of G6PC and PEPCK and adipocytedifferentiation via repression of PPARG. Regulates glucagonrelease in pancreatic alpha-cells via the AMPK-NAMPT-SIRT1 pathwayand the proliferation, glucose-induced insulin secretion andexpression of key lipogenic genes in pancreatic-beta cells.Positively regulates bile acid synthesis by increasing hepaticexpression of CYP7A1 via repression of NR0B2 and NFIL3 which arenegative regulators of CYP7A1. Modulates skeletal muscle oxidativecapacity by regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy;controls mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration by interferingwith the STK11-PRKAA1/2-SIRT1-PPARGC1A signaling pathway.Represses the expression of SERPINE1/PAI1, an important modulatorof cardiovascular disease and the expression of inflammatorycytokines and chemokines in macrophages. Represses gene expressionat a distance in macrophages by inhibiting the transcription ofenhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs). Plays a role in the circadianregulation of body temperature and negatively regulatesthermogenic transcriptional programs in brown adipose tissue(BAT); imposes a circadian oscillation in BAT activity, increasingbody temperature when awake and depressing thermogenesis duringsleep. In concert with NR2E3, regulates transcriptional networkscritical for photoreceptor development and function. In additionto its activity as a repressor, can also act as a transcriptionalactivator. In the ovarian granulosa cells acts as atranscriptional activator of STAR which plays a role in steroidbiosynthesis.

Key regulatorof embryonic development, cellular differentiation, immunity,circadian rhythm as well as lipid, steroid, xenobiotics andglucose metabolism. Considered to have intrinsic transcriptionalactivity, have some natural ligands like oxysterols that act asagonists (25-hydroxycholesterol) or inverse agonists (7-oxygenatedsterols), enhancing or repressing the transcriptional activity,respectively. Recruits distinct combinations of cofactors totarget genes regulatory regions to modulate their transcriptionalexpression, depending on the tissue, time and promoter contexts.Regulates genes involved in photoreceptor development includingOPN1SW, OPN1SM and ARR3 and skeletal muscle development withMYOD1. Required for proper cerebellum development, regulates SHHgene expression, among others, to induce granule cellsproliferation as well as expression of genes involved in calcium-mediated signal transduction. Regulates the circadian expressionof several clock genes, including CLOCK, ARNTL/BMAL1, NPAS2 andCRY1. Competes with NR1D1 for binding to their shared DNA responseelement on some clock genes such as ARNTL/BMAL1, CRY1 and NR1D1itself, resulting in NR1D1-mediated repression or RORA-mediatedactivation of clock genes expression, leading to the circadianpattern of clock genes expression. Therefore influences the periodlength and stability of the clock. Regulates genes involved inlipid metabolism such as apolipoproteins APOA1, APOA5, APOC3 andPPARG. In liver, has specific and redundant functions with RORC aspositive or negative modulator of expression of genes encodingphase I and phase II proteins involved in the metabolism oflipids, steroids and xenobiotics, such as CYP7B1 and SULT2A1.Induces a rhythmic expression of some of these genes. In addition,interplays functionally with NR1H2 and NR1H3 for the regulation ofgenes involved in cholesterol metabolism. Also involved in theregulation of hepatic glucose metabolism through the modulation ofG6PC and PCK1. In adipose tissue, plays a role as negativeregulator of adipocyte differentiation, probably acting throughdual mechanisms. May suppress CEBPB-dependent adipogenesis throughdirect interaction and PPARG-dependent adipogenesis throughcompetition for DNA-binding. Downstream of IL6 and TGFB andsynergistically with RORC isoform 2, is implicated in the lineagespecification of uncommitted CD4(+) T-helper (T(H)) cells intoT(H)17 cells, antagonizing the T(H)1 program. Probably regulatesIL17 and IL17F expression on T(H) by binding to the essentialenhancer conserved non-coding sequence 2 (CNS2) in the IL17-IL17Flocus. Involved in hypoxia signaling by interacting with andactivating the transcriptional activity of HIF1A. May inhibit cellgrowth in response to cellular stress. May exert an anti-inflammatory role by inducing CHUK expression and inhibiting NF-kappa-B signaling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10478845,ECO:0000269|PubMed:11053433, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11252722,ECO:0000269|PubMed:11554739, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12467577,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14570920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15781255,ECO:0000269|PubMed:15790933, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16462772,ECO:0000269|PubMed:17512500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18005000,ECO:0000269|PubMed:18354202, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18658046,ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965867, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21499262,ECO:0000269|PubMed:7926749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9328355,ECO:0000269|PubMed:9862959}.SUBUNIT: Monomer.

Acetylates all four corehistones in nucleosomes. Histone acetylation gives an epigenetictag for transcriptional activation. Mediates cAMP-gene regulationby binding specifically to phosphorylated CREB protein. Mediatesacetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-122' (H3K122ac), a modificationthat localizes at the surface of the histone octamer andstimulates transcription, possibly by promoting nucleosomeinstability. Mediates acetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-27'(H3K27ac). Also functions as acetyltransferase for nonhistonetargets. Acetylates 'Lys-131' of ALX1 and acts as its coactivator.Acetylates SIRT2 and is proposed to indirectly increase thetranscriptional activity of TP53 through acetylation andsubsequent attenuation of SIRT2 deacetylase function. AcetylatesHDAC1 leading to its inactivation and modulation of transcription.Acts as a TFAP2A-mediated transcriptional coactivator in presenceof CITED2. Plays a role as a coactivator of NEUROD1-dependenttranscription of the secretin and p21 genes and controls terminaldifferentiation of cells in the intestinal epithelium. Promotescardiac myocyte enlargement. Can also mediate transcriptionalrepression. Binds to and may be involved in the transformingcapacity of the adenovirus E1A protein. In case of HIV-1infection, it is recruited by the viral protein Tat. RegulatesTat's transactivating activity and may help inducing chromatinremodeling of proviral genes. Acetylates FOXO1 and enhances itstranscriptional activity. Acetylates BCL6 wich disrupts itsability to recruit histone deacetylases and hinders itstranscriptional repressor activity. Participates in CLOCK orNPAS2-regulated rhythmic gene transcription; exhibits a circadianassociation with CLOCK or NPAS2, correlating with increase inPER1/2 mRNA and histone H3 acetylation on the PER1/2 promoter.Acetylates MTA1 at 'Lys-626' which is essential for itstranscriptional coactivator activity (PubMed:10733570,PubMed:11430825, PubMed:11701890, PubMed:12402037,PubMed:12586840, PubMed:12929931, PubMed:14645221,PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15890677, PubMed:16617102,PubMed:16762839, PubMed:18722353, PubMed:18995842,PubMed:23415232, PubMed:23911289, PubMed:23934153,PubMed:8945521). Acetylates XBP1 isoform 2; acetylation increasesprotein stability of XBP1 isoform 2 and enhances itstranscriptional activity (PubMed:20955178). Acetylates PCNA;acetylation promotes removal of chromatin-bound PCNA and itsdegradation during nucleotide excision repair (NER)(PubMed:24939902).

Histone deacetylation givesa tag for epigenetic repression and plays an important role intranscriptional regulation, cell cycle progression anddevelopmental events. Histone deacetylases act via the formationof large multiprotein complexes. Participates in the BCL6transcriptional repressor activity by deacetylating the H3 'Lys-27' (H3K27) on enhancer elements, antagonizing EP300acetyltransferase activity and repressing proximal geneexpression. Probably participates in the regulation oftranscription through its binding to the zinc-finger transcriptionfactor YY1; increases YY1 repression activity. Required to represstranscription of the POU1F1 transcription factor. Acts as amolecular chaperone for shuttling phosphorylated NR2C1 to PMLbodies for sumoylation (PubMed:21444723, PubMed:23911289).Contributes, together with XBP1 isoform 1, to the activation ofNFE2L2-mediated HMOX1 transcription factor gene expression in aPI(3)K/mTORC2/Akt-dependent signaling pathway leading toendothelial cell (EC) survival under disturbed flow/oxidativestress (PubMed:25190803). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21444723,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23911289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25190803}.CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of an N(6)-acetyl-lysine residue ofa histone to yield a deacetylated histone.SUBUNIT: Interacts with HDAC7 and HDAC9.

Integralcomponent of the complex transcription machinery that governscircadian rhythmicity and forms a critical negative limb of thecircadian clock by directly repressing the expression of coreclock components ARTNL/BMAL1, CLOCK and CRY1. Also regulates genesinvolved in metabolic functions, including lipid and bile acidmetabolism, adipogenesis, gluconeogenesis and the macrophageinflammatory response. Acts as a receptor for heme whichstimulates its interaction with the NCOR1/HDAC3 corepressorcomplex, enhancing transcriptional repression. Recognizes twoclasses of DNA response elements within the promoter of its targetgenes and can bind to DNA as either monomers or homodimers,depending on the nature of the response element. Binds as amonomer to a response element composed of the consensus half-sitemotif 5'-[A/G]GGTCA-3' preceded by an A/T-rich 5' sequence(RevRE), or as a homodimer to a direct repeat of the core motifspaced by two nucleotides (RevDR-2). Acts as a potent competitiverepressor of ROR alpha (RORA) function and regulates the levels ofits ligand heme by repressing the expression of PPARGC1A, a potentinducer of heme synthesis. Regulates lipid metabolism byrepressing the expression of APOC3 and by influencing the activityof sterol response element binding proteins (SREBPs); repressesINSIG2 which interferes with the proteolytic activation of SREBPswhich in turn govern the rhythmic expression of enzymes with keyfunctions in sterol and fatty acid synthesis. Regulatesgluconeogenesis via repression of G6PC and PEPCK and adipocytedifferentiation via repression of PPARG. Regulates glucagonrelease in pancreatic alpha-cells via the AMPK-NAMPT-SIRT1 pathwayand the proliferation, glucose-induced insulin secretion andexpression of key lipogenic genes in pancreatic-beta cells.Positively regulates bile acid synthesis by increasing hepaticexpression of CYP7A1 via repression of NR0B2 and NFIL3 which arenegative regulators of CYP7A1. Modulates skeletal muscle oxidativecapacity by regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy;controls mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration by interferingwith the STK11-PRKAA1/2-SIRT1-PPARGC1A signaling pathway.Represses the expression of SERPINE1/PAI1, an important modulatorof cardiovascular disease and the expression of inflammatorycytokines and chemokines in macrophages. Represses gene expressionat a distance in macrophages by inhibiting the transcription ofenhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs). Plays a role in the circadianregulation of body temperature and negatively regulatesthermogenic transcriptional programs in brown adipose tissue(BAT); imposes a circadian oscillation in BAT activity, increasingbody temperature when awake and depressing thermogenesis duringsleep. In concert with NR2E3, regulates transcriptional networkscritical for photoreceptor development and function. In additionto its activity as a repressor, can also act as a transcriptionalactivator. In the ovarian granulosa cells acts as atranscriptional activator of STAR which plays a role in steroidbiosynthesis. In collaboration with SP1, activates GJA1transcription in a heme-independent manner.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:12021280, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15761026,ECO:0000269|PubMed:16968709, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18006707,ECO:0000269|PubMed:19710360, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1971514,ECO:0000269|PubMed:21479263, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22184247,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23398316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2539258}.SUBUNIT: Binds DNA as a monomer or a homodimer.

Participates inthe transcriptional repressor activity produced by BCL6.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:14527417}.SUBUNIT: Forms a large corepressor complex that contains SIN3A/Band histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2. This complex associateswith the thyroid receptor (TR) and the retinoid acid receptor(RAR) in the absence of ligand. Interacts directly with RARA; theinteraction is facilitated with RARA trimethylation. Component ofthe N-Cor repressor complex, at least composed of CBFA2T3, HEXIM1,NCOR1, NCOR2, HDAC3, TBL1X, TBL1XR1, CORO2A and GPS2. Interactswith ZBTB33; the interaction serves to recruit the N-CoR complexto promoter regions containing methylated CpG dinucleotides.Interacts with TRIM28 and KDM3A. Interacts (via the RD1 domain)with BAZ1A (via its N-terminal); the interaction corepresses anumber of NCOR1-regulated genes. Interacts with BCL6, C1D, DACH1,HEXIM1, HDAC7, RORA, RORC, SAP30, SIAH2, SIN3A and SIN3B. Mayinteract with DEAF1.

Under hypoxic conditions, activatesthe transcription of over 40 genes, including erythropoietin,glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, vascular endothelialgrowth factor, HILPDA, and other genes whose protein productsincrease oxygen delivery or facilitate metabolic adaptation tohypoxia. Plays an essential role in embryonic vascularization,tumor angiogenesis and pathophysiology of ischemic disease. Bindsto core DNA sequence 5'-[AG]CGTG-3' within the hypoxia responseelement (HRE) of target gene promoters. Activation requiresrecruitment of transcriptional coactivators such as CREBBP andEP300. Activity is enhanced by interaction with both, NCOA1 orNCOA2. Interaction with redox regulatory protein APEX seems toactivate CTAD and potentiates activation by NCOA1 and CREBBP.Involved in the axonal distribution and transport of mitochondriain neurons during hypoxia. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11292861,ECO:0000269|PubMed:11566883, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15465032,ECO:0000269|PubMed:16543236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16973622,ECO:0000269|PubMed:17610843, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19528298,ECO:0000269|PubMed:20624928, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22009797,ECO:0000269|PubMed:9887100}.SUBUNIT: Interacts with the HIF1A beta/ARNT subunit;heterodimerization is required for DNA binding. Interacts withCOPS5; the interaction increases the transcriptional activity ofHIF1A through increased stability (By similarity). Interacts withEP300 (via TAZ-type 1 domains); the interaction is stimulated inresponse to hypoxia and inhibited by CITED2. Interacts with CREBBP(via TAZ-type 1 domains). Interacts with NCOA1, NCOA2, APEX andHSP90. Interacts (hydroxylated within the ODD domain) with VHLL(via beta domain); the interaction, leads to polyubiquitinationand subsequent HIF1A proteasomal degradation. During hypoxia,sumoylated HIF1A also binds VHL; the interaction promotes theubiquitination of HIF1A. Interacts with SENP1; the interactiondesumoylates HIF1A resulting in stabilization and activation oftranscription. Interacts (Via the ODD domain) with ARD1A; theinteraction appears not to acetylate HIF1A nor have any affect onprotein stability, during hypoxia. Interacts with RWDD3; theinteraction enhances HIF1A sumoylation. Interacts with TSGA10 (Bysimilarity). Interacts with HIF3A (By similarity). Interacts withRORA (via the DNA binding domain); the interaction enhances HIF1Atranscription under hypoxia through increasing protein stability.Interaction with PSMA7 inhibits the transactivation activity ofHIF1A under both normoxic and hypoxia-mimicking conditions.Interacts with USP20. Interacts with RACK1; promotes HIF1Aubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Interacts (viaN-terminus) with USP19. Interacts with SIRT2. Interacts(deacetylated form) with EGLN1.

A higher level expression seenin pituitary tumors as compared to the pituitary gland.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:22009797}.INDUCTION: Under reduced oxygen tension. Induced also by variousreceptor-mediated factors such as growth factors, cytokines, andcirculatory factors such as PDGF, EGF, FGF2, IGF2, TGFB1, HGF,TNF, IL1B/interleukin-1 beta, angiotensin-2 and thrombin. However,this induction is less intense than that stimulated by hypoxia.Repressed by HIPK2 and LIMD1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19046997,ECO:0000269|PubMed:22009797, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22286099}.DOMAIN: Contains two independent C-terminal transactivationdomains, NTAD and CTAD, which function synergistically. Theirtranscriptional activity is repressed by an intervening inhibitorydomain (ID).PTM: In normoxia, is hydroxylated on Pro-402 and Pro-564 in theoxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) by EGLN1/PHD2 andEGLN2/PHD1. EGLN3/PHD3 has also been shown to hydroxylate Pro-564.The hydroxylated prolines promote interaction with VHL, initiatingrapid ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation.Deubiquitinated by USP20.

This hydroxylation is inhibited by theCu/Zn-chelator, Clioquinol. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12080085}.PTM: S-nitrosylation of Cys-800 may be responsible for increasedrecruitment of p300 coactivator necessary for transcriptionalactivity of HIF-1 complex. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12560087,ECO:0000269|PubMed:12914934}.PTM: Requires phosphorylation for DNA-binding. Phosphorylation atSer-247 by CSNK1D/CK1 represses kinase activity and impairs ARNTbinding. Phosphorylation by GSK3-beta and PLK3 promote degradationby the proteasome. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20699359,ECO:0000269|PubMed:20889502}.PTM: Sumoylated; with SUMO1 under hypoxia. Sumoylation is enhancedthrough interaction with RWDD3. Both sumoylation and desumoylationseem to be involved in the regulation of its stability duringhypoxia. Sumoylation can promote either its stabilization or itsVHL-dependent degradation by promoting hydroxyproline-independentHIF1A-VHL complex binding, thus leading to HIF1A ubiquitinationand proteasomal degradation. Desumoylation by SENP1 increases itsstability amd transcriptional activity. There is a disaccordbetween various publications on the effect of sumoylation anddesumoylation on its stability and transcriptional activity.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:15465032, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15776016,ECO:0000269|PubMed:17610843, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17956732}.PTM: Acetylation of Lys-532 by ARD1 increases interaction with VHLand stimulates subsequent proteasomal degradation(PubMed:12464182). Deacetylation of Lys-709 by SIRT2 increases itsinteraction with and hydroxylation by EGLN1 thereby inactivatingHIF1A activity by inducing its proteasomal degradation(PubMed:24681946). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12464182,ECO:0000269|PubMed:24681946}.PTM: Polyubiquitinated; in normoxia, following hydroxylation andinteraction with VHL.

Histone deacetylation givesa tag for epigenetic repression and plays an important role intranscriptional regulation, cell cycle progression anddevelopmental events. Histone deacetylases act via the formationof large multiprotein complexes. Participates in the BCL6transcriptional repressor activity by deacetylating the H3 'Lys-27' (H3K27) on enhancer elements, antagonizing EP300acetyltransferase activity and repressing proximal geneexpression. Probably participates in the regulation oftranscription through its binding to the zinc-finger transcriptionfactor YY1; increases YY1 repression activity. Required to represstranscription of the POU1F1 transcription factor. Acts as amolecular chaperone for shuttling phosphorylated NR2C1 to PMLbodies for sumoylation (PubMed:21444723, PubMed:23911289).Contributes, together with XBP1 isoform 1, to the activation ofNFE2L2-mediated HMOX1 transcription factor gene expression in aPI(3)K/mTORC2/Akt-dependent signaling pathway leading toendothelial cell (EC) survival under disturbed flow/oxidativestress (PubMed:25190803). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21444723,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23911289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25190803}.CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of an N(6)-acetyl-lysine residue ofa histone to yield a deacetylated histone.SUBUNIT: Interacts with HDAC7 and HDAC9.

Integralcomponent of the complex transcription machinery that governscircadian rhythmicity and forms a critical negative limb of thecircadian clock by directly repressing the expression of coreclock components ARTNL/BMAL1, CLOCK and CRY1. Also regulates genesinvolved in metabolic functions, including lipid and bile acidmetabolism, adipogenesis, gluconeogenesis and the macrophageinflammatory response. Acts as a receptor for heme whichstimulates its interaction with the NCOR1/HDAC3 corepressorcomplex, enhancing transcriptional repression. Recognizes twoclasses of DNA response elements within the promoter of its targetgenes and can bind to DNA as either monomers or homodimers,depending on the nature of the response element. Binds as amonomer to a response element composed of the consensus half-sitemotif 5'-[A/G]GGTCA-3' preceded by an A/T-rich 5' sequence(RevRE), or as a homodimer to a direct repeat of the core motifspaced by two nucleotides (RevDR-2). Acts as a potent competitiverepressor of ROR alpha (RORA) function and regulates the levels ofits ligand heme by repressing the expression of PPARGC1A, a potentinducer of heme synthesis. Regulates lipid metabolism byrepressing the expression of APOC3 and by influencing the activityof sterol response element binding proteins (SREBPs); repressesINSIG2 which interferes with the proteolytic activation of SREBPswhich in turn govern the rhythmic expression of enzymes with keyfunctions in sterol and fatty acid synthesis. Regulatesgluconeogenesis via repression of G6PC and PEPCK and adipocytedifferentiation via repression of PPARG. Regulates glucagonrelease in pancreatic alpha-cells via the AMPK-NAMPT-SIRT1 pathwayand the proliferation, glucose-induced insulin secretion andexpression of key lipogenic genes in pancreatic-beta cells.Positively regulates bile acid synthesis by increasing hepaticexpression of CYP7A1 via repression of NR0B2 and NFIL3 which arenegative regulators of CYP7A1. Modulates skeletal muscle oxidativecapacity by regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy;controls mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration by interferingwith the STK11-PRKAA1/2-SIRT1-PPARGC1A signaling pathway.Represses the expression of SERPINE1/PAI1, an important modulatorof cardiovascular disease and the expression of inflammatorycytokines and chemokines in macrophages. Represses gene expressionat a distance in macrophages by inhibiting the transcription ofenhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs). Plays a role in the circadianregulation of body temperature and negatively regulatesthermogenic transcriptional programs in brown adipose tissue(BAT); imposes a circadian oscillation in BAT activity, increasingbody temperature when awake and depressing thermogenesis duringsleep. In concert with NR2E3, regulates transcriptional networkscritical for photoreceptor development and function. In additionto its activity as a repressor, can also act as a transcriptionalactivator. In the ovarian granulosa cells acts as atranscriptional activator of STAR which plays a role in steroidbiosynthesis. In collaboration with SP1, activates GJA1transcription in a heme-independent manner.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:12021280, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15761026,ECO:0000269|PubMed:16968709, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18006707,ECO:0000269|PubMed:19710360, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1971514,ECO:0000269|PubMed:21479263, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22184247,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23398316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2539258}.SUBUNIT: Binds DNA as a monomer or a homodimer.

When covalently bound, it isconjugated to target proteins via an isopeptide bond either as amonomer (monoubiquitin), a polymer linked via different Lysresidues of the ubiquitin (polyubiquitin chains) or a linearpolymer linked via the initiator Met of the ubiquitin (linearpolyubiquitin chains). Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to atarget protein, have different functions depending on the Lysresidue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may beinvolved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD(endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycleregulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in lysosomal degradation;Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked isinvolved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linkedis involved in endocytosis, DNA-damage responses as well as insignaling processes leading to activation of the transcriptionfactor NF-kappa-B.

Key regulatorof embryonic development, cellular differentiation, immunity,circadian rhythm as well as lipid, steroid, xenobiotics andglucose metabolism. Considered to have intrinsic transcriptionalactivity, have some natural ligands like oxysterols that act asagonists (25-hydroxycholesterol) or inverse agonists (7-oxygenatedsterols), enhancing or repressing the transcriptional activity,respectively. Recruits distinct combinations of cofactors totarget genes regulatory regions to modulate their transcriptionalexpression, depending on the tissue, time and promoter contexts.Regulates genes involved in photoreceptor development includingOPN1SW, OPN1SM and ARR3 and skeletal muscle development withMYOD1. Required for proper cerebellum development, regulates SHHgene expression, among others, to induce granule cellsproliferation as well as expression of genes involved in calcium-mediated signal transduction. Regulates the circadian expressionof several clock genes, including CLOCK, ARNTL/BMAL1, NPAS2 andCRY1. Competes with NR1D1 for binding to their shared DNA responseelement on some clock genes such as ARNTL/BMAL1, CRY1 and NR1D1itself, resulting in NR1D1-mediated repression or RORA-mediatedactivation of clock genes expression, leading to the circadianpattern of clock genes expression. Therefore influences the periodlength and stability of the clock. Regulates genes involved inlipid metabolism such as apolipoproteins APOA1, APOA5, APOC3 andPPARG. In liver, has specific and redundant functions with RORC aspositive or negative modulator of expression of genes encodingphase I and phase II proteins involved in the metabolism oflipids, steroids and xenobiotics, such as CYP7B1 and SULT2A1.Induces a rhythmic expression of some of these genes. In addition,interplays functionally with NR1H2 and NR1H3 for the regulation ofgenes involved in cholesterol metabolism. Also involved in theregulation of hepatic glucose metabolism through the modulation ofG6PC and PCK1. In adipose tissue, plays a role as negativeregulator of adipocyte differentiation, probably acting throughdual mechanisms. May suppress CEBPB-dependent adipogenesis throughdirect interaction and PPARG-dependent adipogenesis throughcompetition for DNA-binding. Downstream of IL6 and TGFB andsynergistically with RORC isoform 2, is implicated in the lineagespecification of uncommitted CD4(+) T-helper (T(H)) cells intoT(H)17 cells, antagonizing the T(H)1 program. Probably regulatesIL17 and IL17F expression on T(H) by binding to the essentialenhancer conserved non-coding sequence 2 (CNS2) in the IL17-IL17Flocus. Involved in hypoxia signaling by interacting with andactivating the transcriptional activity of HIF1A. May inhibit cellgrowth in response to cellular stress. May exert an anti-inflammatory role by inducing CHUK expression and inhibiting NF-kappa-B signaling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10478845,ECO:0000269|PubMed:11053433, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11252722,ECO:0000269|PubMed:11554739, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12467577,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14570920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15781255,ECO:0000269|PubMed:15790933, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16462772,ECO:0000269|PubMed:17512500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18005000,ECO:0000269|PubMed:18354202, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18658046,ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965867, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21499262,ECO:0000269|PubMed:7926749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9328355,ECO:0000269|PubMed:9862959}.SUBUNIT: Monomer.

Acetylates all four corehistones in nucleosomes. Histone acetylation gives an epigenetictag for transcriptional activation. Mediates cAMP-gene regulationby binding specifically to phosphorylated CREB protein. Mediatesacetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-122' (H3K122ac), a modificationthat localizes at the surface of the histone octamer andstimulates transcription, possibly by promoting nucleosomeinstability. Mediates acetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-27'(H3K27ac). Also functions as acetyltransferase for nonhistonetargets. Acetylates 'Lys-131' of ALX1 and acts as its coactivator.Acetylates SIRT2 and is proposed to indirectly increase thetranscriptional activity of TP53 through acetylation andsubsequent attenuation of SIRT2 deacetylase function. AcetylatesHDAC1 leading to its inactivation and modulation of transcription.Acts as a TFAP2A-mediated transcriptional coactivator in presenceof CITED2. Plays a role as a coactivator of NEUROD1-dependenttranscription of the secretin and p21 genes and controls terminaldifferentiation of cells in the intestinal epithelium. Promotescardiac myocyte enlargement. Can also mediate transcriptionalrepression. Binds to and may be involved in the transformingcapacity of the adenovirus E1A protein. In case of HIV-1infection, it is recruited by the viral protein Tat. RegulatesTat's transactivating activity and may help inducing chromatinremodeling of proviral genes. Acetylates FOXO1 and enhances itstranscriptional activity. Acetylates BCL6 wich disrupts itsability to recruit histone deacetylases and hinders itstranscriptional repressor activity. Participates in CLOCK orNPAS2-regulated rhythmic gene transcription; exhibits a circadianassociation with CLOCK or NPAS2, correlating with increase inPER1/2 mRNA and histone H3 acetylation on the PER1/2 promoter.Acetylates MTA1 at 'Lys-626' which is essential for itstranscriptional coactivator activity (PubMed:10733570,PubMed:11430825, PubMed:11701890, PubMed:12402037,PubMed:12586840, PubMed:12929931, PubMed:14645221,PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15890677, PubMed:16617102,PubMed:16762839, PubMed:18722353, PubMed:18995842,PubMed:23415232, PubMed:23911289, PubMed:23934153,PubMed:8945521). Acetylates XBP1 isoform 2; acetylation increasesprotein stability of XBP1 isoform 2 and enhances itstranscriptional activity (PubMed:20955178). Acetylates PCNA;acetylation promotes removal of chromatin-bound PCNA and itsdegradation during nucleotide excision repair (NER)(PubMed:24939902).

to intracellular energeticsand participates in the coordination of several separated cellularfunctions such as cell cycle, response to DNA damage, metobolism,apoptosis and autophagy. Can modulate chromatin function throughdeacetylation of histones and can promote alterations in themethylation of histones and DNA, leading to transcriptionalrepression. Deacetylates a broad range of transcription factorsand coregulators, thereby regulating target gene expressionpositively and negatively. Serves as a sensor of the cytosolicratio of NAD(+)/NADH which is altered by glucose deprivation andmetabolic changes associated with caloric restriction. Isessential in skeletal muscle cell differentiation and in responseto low nutrients mediates the inhibitory effect on skeletalmyoblast differentiation which also involves 5'-AMP-activatedprotein kinase (AMPK) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase(NAMPT). Component of the eNoSC (energy-dependent nucleolarsilencing) complex, a complex that mediates silencing of rDNA inresponse to intracellular energy status and acts by recruitinghistone-modifying enzymes. The eNoSC complex is able to sense theenergy status of cell: upon glucose starvation, elevation ofNAD(+)/NADP(+) ratio activates SIRT1, leading to histone H3deacetylation followed by dimethylation of H3 at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me2)by SUV39H1 and the formation of silent chromatin in the rDNAlocus. Deacetylates 'Lys-266' of SUV39H1, leading to itsactivation. Inhibits skeletal muscle differentiation bydeacetylating PCAF and MYOD1. Deacetylates H2A and 'Lys-26' ofHIST1H1E. Deacetylates 'Lys-16' of histone H4 (in vitro). Involvedin NR0B2/SHP corepression function through chromatin remodeling:Recruited to LRH1 target gene promoters by NR0B2/SHP therebystimulating histone H3 and H4 deacetylation leading totranscriptional repression. Proposed to contribute to genomicintegrity via positive regulation of telomere length; however,reports on localization to pericentromeric heterochromatin areconflicting. Proposed to play a role in constitutiveheterochromatin (CH) formation and/or maintenance throughregulation of the available pool of nuclear SUV39H1. Uponoxidative/metabolic stress decreases SUV39H1 degradation byinhibiting SUV39H1 polyubiquitination by MDM2. This increase inSUV39H1 levels enhances SUV39H1 turnover in CH, which in turnseems to accelerate renewal of the heterochromatin whichcorrelates with greater genomic integrity during stress response.Deacetylates 'Lys-382' of p53/TP53 and impairs its ability toinduce transcription-dependent proapoptotic program and modulatecell senescence. Deacetylates TAF1B and thereby represses rDNAtranscription by the RNA polymerase I. Deacetylates MYC, promotesthe association of MYC with MAX and decreases MYC stabilityleading to compromised transformational capability. DeacetylatesFOXO3 in response to oxidative stress thereby increasing itsability to induce cell cycle arrest and resistance to oxidativestress but inhibiting FOXO3-mediated induction of apoptosistranscriptional activity; also leading to FOXO3 ubiquitination andprotesomal degradation. Appears to have a similar effect onMLLT7/FOXO4 in regulation of transcriptional activity andapoptosis. Deacetylates DNMT1; thereby impairs DNMT1methyltransferase-independent transcription repressor activity,modulates DNMT1 cell cycle regulatory function and DNMT1-mediatedgene silencing. Deacetylates RELA/NF-kappa-B p65 therebyinhibiting its transactivating potential and augments apoptosis inresponse to TNF-alpha. Deacetylates HIF1A, KAT5/TIP60, RB1 andHIC1. Deacetylates FOXO1 resulting in its nuclear retention andenhancement of its transcriptional activity leading to increasedgluconeogenesis in liver. Inhibits E2F1 transcriptional activityand apoptotic function, possibly by deacetylation. Involved inHES1- and HEY2-mediated transcriptional repression. In cooperationwith MYCN seems to be involved in transcriptional repression ofDUSP6/MAPK3 leading to MYCN stabilization by phosphorylation at'Ser-62'. Deacetylates MEF2D. Required for antagonist-mediatedtranscription suppression of AR-dependent genes which may belinked to local deacetylation of histone H3. Represses HNF1A-mediated transcription. Required for the repression of ESRRG byCREBZF. Modulates AP-1 transcription factor activity. DeacetylatesNR1H3 AND NR1H2 and deacetylation of NR1H3 at 'Lys-434' positivelyregulates transcription of NR1H3:RXR target genes, promotes NR1H3proteosomal degradation and results in cholesterol efflux; apromoter clearing mechanism after reach round of transcription isproposed. Involved in lipid metabolism. Implicated in regulationof adipogenesis and fat mobilization in white adipocytes byrepression of PPARG which probably involves association with NCOR1and SMRT/NCOR2. Deacetylates ACSS2 leading to its activation, andHMGCS1. Involved in liver and muscle metabolism. Throughdeacteylation and activation of PPARGC1A is required to activatefatty acid oxidation in skeletel muscle under low-glucoseconditions and is involved in glucose homeostasis. Involved inregulation of PPARA and fatty acid beta-oxidation in liver.Involved in positive regulation of insulin secretion in pancreaticbeta cells in response to glucose; the function seems to implytranscriptional repression of UCP2. Proposed to deacetylate IRS2thereby facilitating its insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation.Deacetylates SREBF1 isoform SREBP-1C thereby decreasing itsstability and transactivation in lipogenic gene expression.Involved in DNA damage response by repressing genes which areinvolved in DNA repair, such as XPC and TP73, deacetylatingXRCC6/Ku70, and faciliting recruitment of additional factors tosites of damaged DNA, such as SIRT1-deacetylated NBN can recruitATM to initiate DNA repair and SIRT1-deacetylated XPA interactswith RPA2. Also involved in DNA repair of DNA double-strand breaksby homologous recombination and specifically single-strandannealing independently of XRCC6/Ku70 and NBN. Transcriptionalsuppression of XPC probably involves an E2F4:RBL2 suppressorcomplex and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. Transcriptionalsuppression of TP73 probably involves E2F4 and PCAF. DeacetylatesWRN thereby regulating its helicase and exonuclease activities andregulates WRN nuclear translocation in response to DNA damage.Deacetylates APEX1 at 'Lys-6' and 'Lys-7' and stimulates cellularAP endonuclease activity by promoting the association of APEX1 toXRCC1. Increases p53/TP53-mediated transcription-independentapoptosis by blocking nuclear translocation of cytoplasmicp53/TP53 and probably redirecting it to mitochondria. DeacetylatesXRCC6/Ku70 at 'Lys-539' and 'Lys-542' causing it to sequester BAXaway from mitochondria thereby inhibiting stress-inducedapoptosis. Is involved in autophagy, presumably by deacetylatingATG5, ATG7 and MAP1LC3B/ATG8. Deacetylates AKT1 which leads toenhanced binding of AKT1 and PDK1 to PIP3 and promotes theiractivation. Proposed to play role in regulation of STK11/LBK1-dependent AMPK signaling pathways implicated in cellularsenescence which seems to involve the regulation of theacetylation status of STK11/LBK1. Can deacetylate STK11/LBK1 andthereby increase its activity, cytoplasmic localization andassociation with STRAD; however, the relevance of such activity innormal cells is unclear. In endothelial cells is shown to inhibitSTK11/LBK1 activity and to promote its degradation. DeacetylatesSMAD7 at 'Lys-64' and 'Lys-70' thereby promoting its degradation.Deacetylates CIITA and augments its MHC class II transactivationand contributes to its stability. Deacteylates MECOM/EVI1.Deacetylates PML at 'Lys-487' and this deacetylation promotes PMLcontrol of PER2 nuclear localization. During the neurogenictransition, repress selective NOTCH1-target genes through histonedeacetylation in a BCL6-dependent manner and leading to neuronaldifferentiation. Regulates the circadian expression of severalcore clock genes, including ARNTL/BMAL1, RORC, PER2 and CRY1 andplays a critical role in maintaining a controlled rhythmicity inhistone acetylation, thereby contributing to circadian chromatinremodeling. Deacetylates ARNTL/BMAL1 and histones at the circadiangene promoters in order to facilitate repression by inhibitorycomponents of the circadian oscillator. Deacetylates PER2,facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteosome.Protects cardiomyocytes against palmitate-induced apoptosis(PubMed:11672523, PubMed:12006491, PubMed:14976264,PubMed:14980222, PubMed:15126506, PubMed:15152190,PubMed:15205477, PubMed:15469825, PubMed:15692560,PubMed:16079181, PubMed:16166628, PubMed:16892051,PubMed:16998810, PubMed:17283066, PubMed:17334224,PubMed:17505061, PubMed:17612497, PubMed:17620057,PubMed:17936707, PubMed:18203716, PubMed:18296641,PubMed:18662546, PubMed:18687677, PubMed:19188449,PubMed:19220062, PubMed:19364925, PubMed:19690166,PubMed:19934257, PubMed:20097625, PubMed:20100829,PubMed:20203304, PubMed:20375098, PubMed:20620956,PubMed:20670893, PubMed:20817729, PubMed:21149730,PubMed:21245319, PubMed:21471201, PubMed:21504832,PubMed:21555002, PubMed:21698133, PubMed:21701047,PubMed:21775285, PubMed:21807113, PubMed:21841822,PubMed:21890893, PubMed:21909281, PubMed:21947282,PubMed:22274616).

Phosphorylated by STK4/MST1, resulting ininhibition of SIRT1-mediated p53/TP53 deacetylation.Phosphorylation by MAPK8/JNK1 at Ser-27, Ser-47, and Thr-530 leadsto increased nuclear localization and enzymatic activity.Phosphorylation at Thr-530 by DYRK1A and DYRK3 activatesdeacetylase activity and promotes cell survival. Phosphorylationby mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) at Ser-47inhibits deacetylation activity. Phosphorylated by CaMK2, leadingto increased p53/TP53 and NF-kappa-B p65/RELA deacetylationactivity (By similarity). Phosphorylation at Ser-27 implicatingMAPK9 is linked to protein stability.

Histone deacetylation givesa tag for epigenetic repression and plays an important role intranscriptional regulation, cell cycle progression anddevelopmental events. Histone deacetylases act via the formationof large multiprotein complexes. Participates in the BCL6transcriptional repressor activity by deacetylating the H3 'Lys-27' (H3K27) on enhancer elements, antagonizing EP300acetyltransferase activity and repressing proximal geneexpression. Probably participates in the regulation oftranscription through its binding to the zinc-finger transcriptionfactor YY1; increases YY1 repression activity. Required to represstranscription of the POU1F1 transcription factor. Acts as amolecular chaperone for shuttling phosphorylated NR2C1 to PMLbodies for sumoylation (PubMed:21444723, PubMed:23911289).Contributes, together with XBP1 isoform 1, to the activation ofNFE2L2-mediated HMOX1 transcription factor gene expression in aPI(3)K/mTORC2/Akt-dependent signaling pathway leading toendothelial cell (EC) survival under disturbed flow/oxidativestress (PubMed:25190803). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21444723,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23911289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25190803}.CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of an N(6)-acetyl-lysine residue ofa histone to yield a deacetylated histone.SUBUNIT: Interacts with HDAC7 and HDAC9. Forms a heterologouscomplex at least with YY1. Interacts with DAXX, HDAC10 and DACH1.Found in a complex with NCOR1 and NCOR2.

Integralcomponent of the complex transcription machinery that governscircadian rhythmicity and forms a critical negative limb of thecircadian clock by directly repressing the expression of coreclock components ARTNL/BMAL1, CLOCK and CRY1. Also regulates genesinvolved in metabolic functions, including lipid and bile acidmetabolism, adipogenesis, gluconeogenesis and the macrophageinflammatory response. Acts as a receptor for heme whichstimulates its interaction with the NCOR1/HDAC3 corepressorcomplex, enhancing transcriptional repression. Recognizes twoclasses of DNA response elements within the promoter of its targetgenes and can bind to DNA as either monomers or homodimers,depending on the nature of the response element. Binds as amonomer to a response element composed of the consensus half-sitemotif 5'-[A/G]GGTCA-3' preceded by an A/T-rich 5' sequence(RevRE), or as a homodimer to a direct repeat of the core motifspaced by two nucleotides (RevDR-2). Acts as a potent competitiverepressor of ROR alpha (RORA) function and regulates the levels ofits ligand heme by repressing the expression of PPARGC1A, a potentinducer of heme synthesis. Regulates lipid metabolism byrepressing the expression of APOC3 and by influencing the activityof sterol response element binding proteins (SREBPs); repressesINSIG2 which interferes with the proteolytic activation of SREBPswhich in turn govern the rhythmic expression of enzymes with keyfunctions in sterol and fatty acid synthesis. Regulatesgluconeogenesis via repression of G6PC and PEPCK and adipocytedifferentiation via repression of PPARG. Regulates glucagonrelease in pancreatic alpha-cells via the AMPK-NAMPT-SIRT1 pathwayand the proliferation, glucose-induced insulin secretion andexpression of key lipogenic genes in pancreatic-beta cells.Positively regulates bile acid synthesis by increasing hepaticexpression of CYP7A1 via repression of NR0B2 and NFIL3 which arenegative regulators of CYP7A1. Modulates skeletal muscle oxidativecapacity by regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy;controls mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration by interferingwith the STK11-PRKAA1/2-SIRT1-PPARGC1A signaling pathway.Represses the expression of SERPINE1/PAI1, an important modulatorof cardiovascular disease and the expression of inflammatorycytokines and chemokines in macrophages. Represses gene expressionat a distance in macrophages by inhibiting the transcription ofenhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs). Plays a role in the circadianregulation of body temperature and negatively regulatesthermogenic transcriptional programs in brown adipose tissue(BAT); imposes a circadian oscillation in BAT activity, increasingbody temperature when awake and depressing thermogenesis duringsleep. In concert with NR2E3, regulates transcriptional networkscritical for photoreceptor development and function. In additionto its activity as a repressor, can also act as a transcriptionalactivator. In the ovarian granulosa cells acts as atranscriptional activator of STAR which plays a role in steroidbiosynthesis. In collaboration with SP1, activates GJA1transcription in a heme-independent manner.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:12021280, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15761026,ECO:0000269|PubMed:16968709, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18006707,ECO:0000269|PubMed:19710360, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1971514,ECO:0000269|PubMed:21479263, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22184247,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23398316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2539258}.SUBUNIT: Binds DNA as a monomer or a homodimer.

Part of a complex which promotes histone deacetylationand the formation of repressive chromatin structures which mayimpede the access of basal transcription factors. Participates inthe transcriptional repressor activity produced by BCL6.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:14527417}.SUBUNIT: Forms a large corepressor complex that contains SIN3A/Band histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2. This complex associateswith the thyroid receptor (TR) and the retinoid acid receptor(RAR) in the absence of ligand. Interacts directly with RARA; theinteraction is facilitated with RARA trimethylation. Component ofthe N-Cor repressor complex, at least composed of CBFA2T3, HEXIM1,NCOR1, NCOR2, HDAC3, TBL1X, TBL1XR1, CORO2A and GPS2. Interactswith ZBTB33; the interaction serves to recruit the N-CoR complexto promoter regions containing methylated CpG dinucleotides.Interacts with TRIM28 and KDM3A. Interacts (via the RD1 domain)with BAZ1A (via its N-terminal); the interaction corepresses anumber of NCOR1-regulated genes. Interacts with BCL6, C1D, DACH1,HEXIM1, HDAC7, RORA, RORC, SAP30, SIAH2, SIN3A and SIN3B. Mayinteract with DEAF1. Interacts with RXRA.{ECO:0000269|PubMed:11013263, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11533236,ECO:0000269|PubMed:12590135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14525983,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14527417, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15454082,ECO:0000269|PubMed:16024779, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17452463,ECO:0000269|PubMed:17519354, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20543827,ECO:0000269|PubMed:23372760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23911289,ECO:0000269|PubMed:9328355}.SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00624}.ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;Name=1;IsoId=O75376-1; Sequence=Displayed;Name=2;IsoId=O75376-2; Sequence=VSP_010207, VSP_010208;Name=3; Synonyms=b;IsoId=O75376-3; Sequence=VSP_046468, VSP_010207, VSP_046469,VSP_046470;Note=No experimental confirmation available.;DOMAIN: The N-terminal region contains three independent domainsthat are capable of mediating transcriptional repression (RD1, RD2and RD3).DOMAIN: The C-terminal region contains two separate nuclearreceptor-interacting domains (ID1 and ID2), each of which containsa conserved sequence referred to as the CORNR box.

Key regulatorof embryonic development, cellular differentiation, immunity,circadian rhythm as well as lipid, steroid, xenobiotics andglucose metabolism. Considered to have intrinsic transcriptionalactivity, have some natural ligands like oxysterols that act asagonists (25-hydroxycholesterol) or inverse agonists (7-oxygenatedsterols), enhancing or repressing the transcriptional activity,respectively. Recruits distinct combinations of cofactors totarget genes regulatory regions to modulate their transcriptionalexpression, depending on the tissue, time and promoter contexts.Regulates genes involved in photoreceptor development includingOPN1SW, OPN1SM and ARR3 and skeletal muscle development withMYOD1. Required for proper cerebellum development, regulates SHHgene expression, among others, to induce granule cellsproliferation as well as expression of genes involved in calcium-mediated signal transduction. Regulates the circadian expressionof several clock genes, including CLOCK, ARNTL/BMAL1, NPAS2 andCRY1. Competes with NR1D1 for binding to their shared DNA responseelement on some clock genes such as ARNTL/BMAL1, CRY1 and NR1D1itself, resulting in NR1D1-mediated repression or RORA-mediatedactivation of clock genes expression, leading to the circadianpattern of clock genes expression. Therefore influences the periodlength and stability of the clock. Regulates genes involved inlipid metabolism such as apolipoproteins APOA1, APOA5, APOC3 andPPARG. In liver, has specific and redundant functions with RORC aspositive or negative modulator of expression of genes encodingphase I and phase II proteins involved in the metabolism oflipids, steroids and xenobiotics, such as CYP7B1 and SULT2A1.Induces a rhythmic expression of some of these genes. In addition,interplays functionally with NR1H2 and NR1H3 for the regulation ofgenes involved in cholesterol metabolism. Also involved in theregulation of hepatic glucose metabolism through the modulation ofG6PC and PCK1. In adipose tissue, plays a role as negativeregulator of adipocyte differentiation, probably acting throughdual mechanisms. May suppress CEBPB-dependent adipogenesis throughdirect interaction and PPARG-dependent adipogenesis throughcompetition for DNA-binding. Downstream of IL6 and TGFB andsynergistically with RORC isoform 2, is implicated in the lineagespecification of uncommitted CD4(+) T-helper (T(H)) cells intoT(H)17 cells, antagonizing the T(H)1 program. Probably regulatesIL17 and IL17F expression on T(H) by binding to the essentialenhancer conserved non-coding sequence 2 (CNS2) in the IL17-IL17Flocus. Involved in hypoxia signaling by interacting with andactivating the transcriptional activity of HIF1A. May inhibit cellgrowth in response to cellular stress. May exert an anti-inflammatory role by inducing CHUK expression and inhibiting NF-kappa-B signaling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10478845,ECO:0000269|PubMed:11053433, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11252722,ECO:0000269|PubMed:11554739, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12467577,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14570920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15781255,ECO:0000269|PubMed:15790933, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16462772,ECO:0000269|PubMed:17512500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18005000,ECO:0000269|PubMed:18354202, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18658046,ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965867, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21499262,ECO:0000269|PubMed:7926749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9328355,ECO:0000269|PubMed:9862959}.SUBUNIT: Monomer.

Acts as a coactivator, in the SIK/TORCsignaling pathway, being active when dephosphorylated and actsindependently of CREB1 'Ser-133' phosphorylation. Enhances theinteraction of CREB1 with TAF4. Regulates gluconeogenesis as acomponent of the LKB1/AMPK/TORC2 signaling pathway. Regulates theexpression of specific genes such as the steroidogenic gene, StAR.Potent coactivator of PPARGC1A and inducer of mitochondrialbiogenesis in muscle cells. Also coactivator for TAX activation ofthe human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) long terminalrepeats (LTR). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14506290,ECO:0000269|PubMed:14536081, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15454081,ECO:0000269|PubMed:16809310, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16817901,ECO:0000269|PubMed:16980408, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17210223}.SUBUNIT: Binds, as a tetramer, through its N-terminal region, withthe bZIP domain of CREB1. 'Arg-314' in the bZIP domain of CREB1 isessential for this interaction. Interaction, via its C-terminal,with TAF4, enhances recruitment of TAF4 to CREB1 (By similarity).Interacts with PPP3CA/calcineurin alpha, SIK2 and 14-3-3 proteins,YWHAB and YWHAG. Interaction with the human T-cell leukemia virustype 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein is essential for optimal transcriptionactivation by Tax. Interaction with RFWD2/COP1 mediates nuclearexport and degradation of CRTC2 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15589160}.Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15589160}.

May, B, 2009-05-17 22:04:50","At the center of the mammalian circadian clock is a negative transcription/translation-based feedback loop: The BMAL1:CLOCK/NPAS2 (ARNTL:CLOCK/NPAS2) heterodimer transactivates CRY and PER genes by binding E-box elements in their promoters; the CRY and PER proteins then inhibit transactivation by BMAL1:CLOCK/NPAS2. BMAL1:CLOCK/NPAS2 activates transcription of CRY, PER, and several other genes in the morning. Levels of PER and CRY proteins rise during the day and inhibit expression of CRY, PER, and other BMAL1:CLOCK/NPAS2-activated genes in the afternoon and evening. During the night CRY and PER proteins are targeted for degradation by phosphorylation and polyubiquitination, allowing the cycle to commence again in the morning. <br>Transcription of the BMAL1 (ARNTL) gene is controlled by ROR-alpha and REV-ERBA (NR1D1), both of which are targets of BMAL1:CLOCK/NPAS2 in mice and both of which compete for the same element (RORE) in the BMAL1 promoter. ROR-alpha (RORA) activates transcription of BMAL1; REV-ERBA represses transcription of BMAL1. This mutual control forms a secondary, reinforcing loop of the circadian clock. REV-ERBA shows strong circadian rhythmicity and confers circadian expression on BMAL1. <br>BMAL1 can form heterodimers with either CLOCK or NPAS2, which act redundantly but show different tissue specificity. The BMAL1:CLOCK and BMAL1:NPAS2 heterodimers activate a set of genes that possess E-box elements (consensus CACGTG) in their promoters. This confers circadian expression on the genes. The PER genes (PER1, PER2, PER3) and CRY genes (CRY1, CRY2) are among those activated by BMAL1:CLOCK and BMAL1:NPAS2. PER and CRY mRNA accumulates during the morning and the proteins accumulate during the afternoon. PER and CRY proteins form complexes in the cytosol and these are bound by either CSNK1D or CSNK1E kinases which phosphorylate PER and CRY. The phosphorylated PER:CRY:kinase complex is translocated into the nucleus due to the nuclear localization signal of PER and CRY. Within the nucleus the PER:CRY complexes bind BMAL1:CLOCK and BMAL1:NPAS2, inhibiting their transactivation activity and their phosphorylation. This reduces expression of the target genes of BMAL1:CLOCK and BMAL1:NPAS2 during the afternoon and evening. <br>PER:CRY complexes also traffic out of the nucleus into the cytosol due to the nuclear export signal of PER. During the night PER:CRY complexes are polyubiquitinated and degraded, allowing the cycle to begin again. Phosphorylated PER is bound by Beta-TrCP1, a cytosolic F-box type component of some SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases. CRY is bound by FBXL3, a nucleoplasmic F-box type component of some SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases. Phosphorylation of CRY1 by Adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) enhances degradation of CRY1. PER and CRY are subsequently polyubiquitinated and proteolyzed by the 26S proteasome.<br>The circadian clock is cell-autonomous and some, but not all cells of the body exhibit circadian rhythms in metabolism, cell division, and gene transcription. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus is the major clock in the body and receives its major input from light (via retinal neurons) and a minor input from nutrient intake. The SCN and other brain tissues determine waking and feeding cycles and influence the clocks in other tissues by hormone secretion and nervous stimulation. Independently of the SCN, other tissues such as liver receive inputs from signals from the brain and from nutrients.","Reviewed: Albrecht, U, 2010-06-23","Reviewed: D'Eustachio, P, 2009-05-26 22:13:22","Reviewed: Hirota, T, 2010-06-23","Reviewed: Kay, SA, 2010-06-23","Reviewed: Delaunay, F, 2010-06-23","Authored: May, B, 2009-05-17 22:04:50"],"dataSource":["Reactome"],"title":["Circadian Clock"]}}
