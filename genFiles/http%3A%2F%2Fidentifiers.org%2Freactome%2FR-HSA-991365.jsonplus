GABA B receptors are activated upon ligand binding. The GABA B1 subunit binds ligand and GABA B2 subunit modulates the activity of adenylate cyclase via the intracellular loop.? GABA B receptors show inhibitory activity via Galpha/G0 subunits via the inhibition of adenylate cyclase or via the activity of Gbeta/gamma subunits that mediate the inhibition of voltage gated Ca2+ channels."],"dataSource":["Reactome"],"title":["Activation of GABAB receptors"]}}
