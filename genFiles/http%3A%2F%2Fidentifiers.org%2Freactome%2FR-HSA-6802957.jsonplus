{"nodes":[],"edges":[],"pathwayMetadata":{"comments":["The importance of the RAS/RAF/MAPK cascade in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival is highlighted by the fact that components of the pathway are mutated with high frequency in a large number of human cancers. Activating mutations in RAS are found in approximately one third of human cancers, while ~8% of tumors express an activated form of BRAF. RAS pathway activation is also achieved in a smaller subset of cancers by loss-of-function mutations in negative regulators of RAS signaling, such as the RAS GAP NF1(reviewed in Prior et al, 2012; Pylayeva-Gupta et al, 2011; Stephen et al, 2014; Lavoie and Therrien, 2015; Lito et al, 2013; Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014; Maertens and Cichowski, 2014).","Edited: Rothfels, Karen, 2015-05-18","Reviewed: Stephens, Robert M, 2016-08-05","Authored: Rothfels, Karen, 2015-05-18"],"dataSource":["Reactome"],"title":["Oncogenic MAPK signaling"]}}
